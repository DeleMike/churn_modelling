Numerical Feature importance

- credit-score not too valuable as a feature
- age is really important!
- tenure not too important
- balance seem to be imprtant - slightly good
- *numofproducts is really weird, it shoots up and down going from good model to bad model or bad model to good model. Might delete feature...
- *estimatedsalary is really acting like a baseline model. not good, not bad
